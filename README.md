Project Title: Predicting Salaries of Different Data Science Jobs

By Lance Belen, Darby Vogt, Laura Gatt, and Luke Zuell.

A university project for Mathematics for Computing 2 (MATH2412), a course at RMIT University Australia.

The technology stack used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, SQL, Excel, Jupyter Notebook

This project focuses on applying statistical modeling techniques by presenting our chosen problem, detailed analysis of the data, and formal application of model selection strategies.

Our chosen problem surrounds the topic of the salaries of different Data Science jobs. Specifically, we looked for patterns and analysed the data to answer different questions people may have regarding the topic.
Questions such as: "What is the highest paying Data Science job?" or "What is the reasonable salary for a specific Data Science job?".

For this end-to-end project, my team and I went through data preparation, data exploration, data visualisation, and statistical modeling.
